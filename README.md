# t0

A stupid silly clone of v0 that generates regular HTML. Be free from the ecosystem of React and NextJS. This is 
really only for me to play around with LangGraph and LangChain but tbh is this becomes useful for me I would love
that.


## Installation
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
