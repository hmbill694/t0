# We actually kinda been working on this. Wow

Well, well, well. Looks like I can actually continue working on a side project. So what's going on with it rn?

Well I was wrong about LangChain and LangGraph being easy to understand. Fuck me did I actaully have a hard time getting
anything more complex than the demo working but we're there. I offically made a very small step towards getting something done.

After fighting with prevously mentioned packages I have a app that will tell me a story about a provided topic and 
write to a file to save the story. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

Now that I've got this built I think I'm actually ready to get cracking on this thing.

## What to do next?

I think now it's time for me to integrate Turso, Drizzle and get all my DB shit stood up.
